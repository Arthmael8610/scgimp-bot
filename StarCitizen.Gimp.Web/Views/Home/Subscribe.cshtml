<h3>Security &amp; Privacy</h3>
<p>We take security very seriously and do our best to protect your email address;</p>
<ul>
    <li>The site supports SSL, so when you submit your email address it is encrypted and it is also protected by CSRF.</li>
    <li>No data is shared to any 3rd parties other than for analytics and protection against bots as per our privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Security recommendations &amp; alternate options</h4>
<p>A good precaution to take is to not subscribe with the email address that you registered with for Star Citizen and rather use a new alias or address that gets forwarded to your main address.</p>
<h3>Toubleshooting</h3>
<p>If you are not receiving email notifications make sure that you subscribed with the correct email address and that the sender address noreply@scgimp.com is whitelisted and does not end up in your junk folder.</p>
